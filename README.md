# Hanabi Client

## Overview
This was a group project for school. The goal was to implement a client
that would allow a user to play a game of Hanabi with multiple players or
with AI players. Hanabi is a multiplayer card game, more information can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanabi_(card_game)). The Client connected to a local game server that was provided
to us allowing each client to send and recieve information keeping the game state
consistent between all clients in the same game.

## Features
* A functional GUI displaying all necessary game data
* Multiplayer (other users)
* All Hanabi game actions were implemented this includes
  + Playing a Card
  + Discarding a Card
  + Giving Information
* Additonally we implemented the following actions
  + View Game Log -- displayed all game actions perfromed
  + View Discard Pile -- displayed all discared cards
  
 ## Issues
 * The AI requirement was never implemented
 * The server is no longer running (might work on this as a side project)
 * Due to time constraints and limited access to the server
 some of the project was implemented in a "work around" or "hacky"
 manner to meet our demonstration deadline
 
 ## Demo
 Note that the jar file will work and run however with the server being
 down no games can be created or joined
